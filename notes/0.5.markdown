## Change in Setting and Task Key Namespace

*sbt-editsource* setting and task keys are already inside in inner
`EditSource` object, for namespace scoping. This revision adds a trick by
[Josh Suereth][], to make usage easier. Basically, the keys are now defined
like this:

    object EditSource extends Plugin {
      object EditSource {
        val Config = config("editsource") extend(Runtime)

        val sources = SettingKey[Seq[File]](
          "source-files", "List of sources to transform"
        ) in Config
    
        val targetDirectory = SettingKey[File](
          "target-directory", "Where to copy edited files"
        ) in Config

        ...
      }
    }

Putting the `in Config` after *each* setting or task changes the `build.sbt`
usage pattern from the clunky

   EditSource.sources in EditSource <<= ...

to the far more outrageously winning

   EditSource.sources <<= ...

## Changes in Settings

* `EditSource.sourceFiles` is now `EditSource.sources`, for consistency with
  other SBT plugins and settings.

* Merged in a patch from [David M. Lee][], changing `editTask` to return
  a `Seq[File]`, allowing one to add `editTask` as a `resourceGenerator`,
  running it as part of the `package` command. For instance:

    resourceGenerators in Compile <+=
      (EditSource.edit in EditSource.Config).identity
