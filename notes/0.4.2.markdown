* Put plugin settings into a sub-object, so they don't clash with
  other settings on (auto) import into `build.sbt`. Accessing a setting
  is now accomplished with:

        EditSource.sourceFiles in EditSource.Config <<= baseDirectory(...)

* Converted code to conform with standard Scala coding style.
* Now published for Scala 2.9.0 and 2.9.0-1, as well as 2.8.1.
